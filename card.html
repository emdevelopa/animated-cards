                    </header>

                    <p>Invisalign is a popular alternative to traditional braces to help you straighten your teeth and
                        give you that beautiful
                        smile you've always wanted. Developed by Align Technology, Invisalign consists of clear
                        treatment trays that gently (and
                        discreetly) move your teeth over time. It's a highly effective orthodontic treatment for mild to
                        moderate crowding and
                        spacing issues. The retainers are worn for 22 hours per day, allowing plenty of time to eat and
                        clean your teeth.</p>

                    </header>

                    <p>Dental implants are a great long term solution for people who have lost one or more of your
                        natural teeth. The implants
                        are made of a strong and durable material that integrates with your jawbone. This allows the
                        implant to function like a
                        natural tooth and withstand the forces of chewing. A crown or bridge is attached to the implant
                        to create a
                        natural-looking tooth replacement. While dental implants are more costly initially than other
                        dental treatments, they
                        are a long-term solution that can last for many years - enhancing your smile and oral health
                        along with protecting bone

                        <h3>Wisdom Teeth Removal</h3>
                    </header>

                    <p>Wisdom teeth are permanent molars that usually erupt in the late teens or early 20s.
                        Unfortunately, they are often
                        impacted and don't have the room to grow properly. Most people choose to undergo wisdom teeth
                        removal to protect their
                        dental health. Without extraction, impacted wisdom teeth can lead to a number of long term
                        problems, including pain,
                        infection, gum disease, damage to nearby teeth and even cysts in the worst case scenario. They
                        are also prone to decay,
                        which can further spread to other healthy teeth. Our dentists provide comfortable, expert care
                        for wisdom teeth, using
                        local anesthetic or conscious sedation if needed. The surgery takes about 30 minutes to an hour.
                        Our dentists can
                        perform a thorough exam to help determine if wisdom teeth removal is the right choice for you.

                        <h3>Dental Crowns</h3>
                    </header>

                    <p>Dental crowns are tooth-shaped caps that are placed over a damaged tooth to protect it and
                        restore its function. Made to
                        match the color of your teeth, dental crowns are often completely invisible. They are made of
                        ultra-strong, tooth-like
                        materials that can withstand biting and chewing forces. This makes them a good option for teeth
                        that have been weakened
                        by decay, a large filling, or a root canal, restoring the function of a damaged tooth. Consult
                        with one of our expert
                        dentists to decide if a dental crown is the best choice for you.</p>
